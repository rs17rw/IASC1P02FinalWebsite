  <p>Snowboarding is by far my favorite sport of all time. Before I started to snowboard, I was initially a skier. I always saw people snowboarding and knew that I would prefer it over skiing. When I was 10, my parents let me switch to snowboarding, and I have never looked back. I picked up snowboarding very quickly in the first three years, and I was getting to be very good. When I was thirteen, I joined the Boler Mountain Competitive Snowboard Freestyle Team. I would train for six hours a week then go to three or four competitions throughout the season. At contests, I always rode in the slopestyle division which means that I was judged on jumps and rails. I got top ten at every even and sometimes even getting on the podium. I have also competed in one halfpipe contest where I managed to get second place. Once I realize that I would not be a professional snowboarder I decided to get my certifications so that I could teach people how to snowboard. I got my Level 1 Snowboard Instructor and my Level 1 Park. I applied for a job as the Boler Mountain Competitive Snowboard Freestyle Team coach. I got the job and started training kids how to snowboard competitively and compete. Being a coach, I was in charge of the children's safety when learning high-risk snowboarding maneuvers. I was also had to make sure all of the contestant's waivers were filled out. I also had to keep an eye on the overall well being of the children and make sure that they were having fun. Being able to snowboard as a job has been a dream come true. I love watching kids progress in snowboarding just like I did at their age. Snowboarding is my passion, and I will never stop trying to push myself and learn more about the sport.
