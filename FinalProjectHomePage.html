  <p>Hello, my name is Robert Sharp. I am from London, Ontario and I am 18 years old. I was born in London on December 24, 1999, at 6:40 am. Since I am born past December 22 my zodiac sign is Capricorn. My family consists of my mom Laura, my dad Wayne, my sister Rachel and my cat Willow. My sister is three years older than me making her the oldest child in the family. I went to Clara Brenton Public School from grade 1 to grade 8. At Clara Brenton, I played on the basketball and volleyball team. I was also a pizza lunch helper and hall monitor. I graduated from Clara Brenton with honors meaning that I had over an 80% average. I then went to Oakridge Secondary School from grade 9 to 12. At Oakridge, I played on the volleyball team for all four years of my high school career. Our volleyball team won WOSSA when I was in grade 9, 10 and 12. In my grade 12 year we made it to OFSAA but unfortunately lost in the semi-finals. I also played on the rugby team while I was at Oakridge. I was on the rugby team from grade 10 to grade 12. In grade 10 the coach granted me co-captaincy. Our team did not do as well as we had hoped, but I still had a great time. I was also apart of the Oak Radio club. Oak Radio played O' Canada and presented the morning announcements every day. My favorite classes at Oakridge were Communications Technology and Sports and Entertainment Marketing. In Communications Technology you would learn about how to use different types of soft wear in an educational and artistic way. Some of the software that we used was Adobe Photoshop, Blender, Adobe Flash and many more. In Sports and Entertainment Marketing we learned about marketing in the sports and entertainment sectors. I graduated from Oakridge as an Ontario Scholar, meaning that I had over an 80% average for all four years of high school. After graduating from Oakridge, I decided to go to Brock University to study Sports Management. I am currently finishing up my first semester here at Brock, and I have been having a great time so far. My first job was at Boler Mountain as the coach of the Snowboard Freestyle Team. The team would train for six and a half hours every week. Our team would travel to different ski resorts throughout the season to participate in snowboard contests. I have coached this team for the past three seasons but unfortunately will not be going back because of school. My second job was working at Archies Surf Shop located in Grand Bend, Ontario. I was responsible for keeping the store clean, receiving and putting out new products, folding clothes and helping customers. I have worked there the past three summers but unfortunately will not be going back because I want to change it up.
