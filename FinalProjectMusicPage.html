  <p>Music has played an enormous role in my life. I have always loved music ever since I was a kid and I still do to this day. When I was very young, my parents put me into piano lessons. I enjoyed the piano and got pretty good at it, but it wasn't my favorite thing to do. I really enjoyed rhythm in songs and making my beats. Naturally, I asked my parents if I could start to take drum lessons. I fell in love with drumming once I started and I developed a passion for it. I would go to drum lessons once a week and try to practice every day. It became a tradition that every Tuesday my dad would take me to drum lessons then we would get chicken wings after. I took drum lessons for five years, and I began to become pretty good. My favorite thing to do in the summer was going to rock and roll camp and play the drums. At rock camp, you would get put into a group and learn three or four songs. Once you learned those songs with your band, you would then perform them at the end of the week. Playing with other kids and making music was very rewarding and fun. Unfortunately, I had to stop taking drum lessons because my instructor became to busy with her career as a drummer and could no longer teach. I still play the drums, but I do not take lessons anymore. I also enjoy listening to music and trying to find new music that people haven't heard yet. My favorite generas of music are rock, punk, rap, and indie. I have always loved rock and roll, and I still do to this day. Some of my favorite rock bands and performers are Neck Deep, Trophy Eyes, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Queen. Some of my favorite rap artists are Eminem, Wiz Khalifa, and Mac Miller. I also love going to concerts and seeing bands and artists live. For my first concert, I was the band, Hedley. It was an entertaining concert, and they played really well. My favorite concert I have been to was to see Neck Deep. Neck Deep was very high energy and exciting making it an incredible show.
